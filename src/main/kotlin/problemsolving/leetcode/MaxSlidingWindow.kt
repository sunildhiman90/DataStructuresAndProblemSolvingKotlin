/**
 * if (currentWindowQueue.size == k) {
 *         currentWindowQueue.removeFirst()
 *  }
 *
 *  This may not work in some scenarios, Becoz at some particualr time we may have some 0 or 1 index from very first window,
 *  and window size never reaches k becoz we are removing smaller elements
 *
 *  Check this example: [1,3,1,2,0,5] and k = 3
 *  after first window loop: Queue: [1,2] indexes
 *  after second loop ist iteration: [1,3] indexes
 *  after second loop 2nd iteration: [1,3], it will choose element at index 1(that is 3) as largest, but we are on index 4(that is 0), so current window is [1,2,0], so 2 should be answer here
 *
 * Thats why we need to check index difference with first element of queue,
 * it should not be more than currentIndex - k
 * NOw consider same scenario with it will check i-k => 4-3 => 1, SO index window should be [2,3,4] if 4 is current index
 * So it will remove 1st index from queue, becoz that is at first index
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: APPROACH 1
 * **
 *  * Complexity Analysis
 *  * Time complexity: O(n).
 *  *
 *  * At first glance, it may look like the time complexity of this algorithm should be O(n*n),
 *  because there is a nested while loop inside the for loop.
 *  However, each element can only be added to the deque once,
 *  which means the deque is limited to n pushes.
 *  Every iteration of the while loop uses 1 pop,
 *  which means the while loop will not iterate more than n times in total,
 *  across all iterations of the for loop.
 *  An easier way to think about this is that in the worst case,
 *  every element will be pushed and popped once. This gives a time complexity of O(2â‹…n)=O(n).
 *
 *  * Space complexity: O(k)
 *  * The size of the deque can grow a maximum up to a size of k.
