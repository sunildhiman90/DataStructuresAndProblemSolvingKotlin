/**
 *
 * Check for bridge Logic
 *
 * First understand the Tarjanâ€™s Algo, and then apply logic given below
 *
 * Suppose there is an edge between 2 nodes u and v in graph,
 * then there will be bridge only if u should be visited before v and all its neighbors =>  dt[u] < lowestDt[v]
 * HEre dt[u] means, when u was visited..
 * and lowestDt[v] means lowest discovery time from v and all its neighbors
 *
 * Suppose we are traversing u to v currently, it means v and its neighbors are not traversed yet from any of neighbors of u
 * and v can be traversed from only u with single path.
 *
 * Means for traversing either v or any of its neighbors , only single path exists that is only from u then its bridge
