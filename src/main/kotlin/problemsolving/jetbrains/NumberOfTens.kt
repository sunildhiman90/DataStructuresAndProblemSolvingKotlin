/**
 * The number of tens
There is a non-negative integer N (0 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 1000000).
Find the number of tens in it (next to the last digit of the number).
If there is only one digit, you can consider that the number of tens equals zero.

    val remainder1 = number%100 //Because we need to count number of tens in last 2 digits(next to the last digit of the number), so dividing any number by 100 will return the last 2 digits as remainder
