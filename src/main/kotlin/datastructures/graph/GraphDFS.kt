/**
 * Complexity Analysis of DFS Algorithm
Time complexity: Since we consider every vertex exactly once and every edge atmost twice, therefore time complexity is
O(V+2E)â‰ƒO(V+E), where
V is the number of vertices and
E is the number of edges in the given graph.

Space Complexity:
O(V), because we need an auxiliary visited array/set of size V
