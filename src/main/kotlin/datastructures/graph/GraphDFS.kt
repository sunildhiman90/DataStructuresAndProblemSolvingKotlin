/**
 * Theory:
 * The idea of the depth-first search algorithm is to start from an arbitrary node of the graph
 * and to explore as far as possible before coming back i.e. moving to an adjacent node until there is no unvisited adjacent node.
 * Then backtrack and check for other unvisited nodes and repeat the same process for them.
 * Here backtracking means, "When all the neighbors of a vertex (say x) are visited, the algorithm ends for vertex x
 * so we return and check neighbors of the vertex that initiated the call to vertex x"
 */

/**
 * Complexity Analysis of DFS Algorithm
Time complexity: Since we consider every vertex exactly once and every edge atmost twice(once while backtracking), therefore time complexity is
O(V+2E)â‰ƒO(V+E), where
V is the number of vertices and
E is the number of edges in the given graph.

Space Complexity:
O(V), because we need an auxiliary visited array/set of size V
